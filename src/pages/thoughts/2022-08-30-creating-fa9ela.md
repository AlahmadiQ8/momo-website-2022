I'm building another side project that I hope kicks off. This time I'm making an Arabic-first content publishing platform. Think "[Medium.com][1]", but for Arabic writers only.

In this essay, I'll explain why I am building this.

## Personal Connection

Ever since I was a kid, I've loved to write. But, after college, I began writing less and less, causing my skills to stagnate.

I have tried blogging but always lose the momentum necessary to publish regularly, and I can't even remember how many times I recreated my website to start blogging again.

Recreating my website with a new, shiny design was supposed to motivate me to write content more consistently.

It worked, but after a few months, my momentum faltered, and I stopped writing. So this time, I'm being bold and making an open platform for anyone to publish their writing. I'll be my first user and test it myself.

## A Missing Gap For The Arabic Language

Why don't we have a platform like [Medium.com][2], but for the Arabic language, where anyone can instantly write and share their work?

I've always loved Medium's gorgeous reading experience and intuitive writing interface. But Medium truly shines in how easily anyone can write and publish their work without needing to be tech-savvy.

Blogger, WordPress, and Wix all support the Arabic language. But, these platforms require a basic familiarity with English. Arabic writers using these platforms may find publishing their work quite challenging.

I dream that Fa9ela will further enrich the world of digital Arabic content by eliminating the publishing barriers many Arabic writers face.

## Final thoughts

I'm not sure if fa9ela.com will grow beyond being a hobby/toy project. No matter what, though, I am excited to begin this journey.
