# Why I'm building fa9ela.com

## Personal Connection

I've loved writing since I was a kid. But it was one of those activities I rarely worked on improving beyond college. I have tried blogging but never kept the momentum of consistently writing to improve. I lost count of how many times I recreated my website to start blogging again.

The idea behind recreating my website is to be more motivated to write content for it once I get a fancy new website design. It worked, but the momentum quickly lost stamina after a few months.

This time I won't recreate my website again but will build an open platform for anyone to publish their writing.

## A Missing Gap For The Arabic Language

Why don't we have a platform like [medium.com][1], but for the Arabic language, where anyone can instantly write and share with work?

I've always loved Medium's gorgeous reading experience and exceptional writing experience. But I think it truly shines in how easily anyone can instantly start writing without having to be tech-savvy.

While many platforms support the Arabic language, such as Blogger, WordPress, and Wix, they require some English basics or basic web knowledge. Someone who doesn't speak English will face many barriers to publishing their work.

I dream that Fa9ela will further enrich the digital Arabic content by eliminating barriers to publishing to anyone, regardless of their English or tech literacy.

## Final thoughts

I don't know if fa9ela.com will grow beyond being a hobby or toy project. But I am still somehow excited for this journey.
